    explanation:
      "Have you ever imagined what happens when you have too much salt in your body? Well, it can lead to various health issues like high blood pressure, stroke or even heart diseases. It is for this reason that one should not have too much salt in their food. Salt, which is also known as sodium chloride is used in various food preparations to enhance the taste and is a stabilizer. It is also used as a preservative, as bacteria cannot thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The mineral present in salt - sodium, is required by the human body to maintain a proper balance of the body. Packed with potassium, a banana can help in keeping your blood pressure levels in check after a salty meal, which can lower the risk of a stroke over time. This fruit is also rich in fibre and thus it can help in lowering the risk of heart diseases as well. It is yet another food rich in potassium that can counter the risk of high sodium. Not just that, it can change your taste quickly while keeping your gut healthy.",

A robotic gripper can’t do two things at once, that is, hold an object tightly and gently when required. Engineers at Stanford University have developed a robotic hand called ‘farmHand’ capable of handling various items from raw eggs and grape bunches to jugs and basketballs. Inspired by geckos, the robotic hand has a similar way of attaching its grippers to an object, without applying extra inward forces.  ",

Apart from that, fish has a heating effect which mixes with milk and creates an imbalance, which causes discomfort, bloating and can often lead to skin allergies.Mixing milk with sour and citrus fruits or ingredients is a strict “No’’ this is because the presence of vitamin C and citric acid in sour foods like orange and lemon when combined with milk can coagulate and lead to acid reflux, heartburn, upset stomach and allergies.

      "Have you ever imagined what happens when you have too much salt in your body? Well, it can lead to various health issues like high blood pressure, stroke or even heart diseases. It is for this reason that one should not have too much salt in their food. Salt, which is also known as sodium chloride is used in various food preparations to enhance the taste and is a stabilizer. It is also used as a preservative, as bacteria cannot thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The mineral present in salt - sodium, is required by the human body to maintain a proper balance of the body. Packed with potassium, a banana can help in keeping your blood pressure levels in check after a salty meal, which can lower the risk of a stroke over time. This fruit is also rich in fibre and thus it can help in lowering the risk of heart diseases as well. It is yet another food rich in potassium that can counter the risk of high sodium.

    explanation:
      "During the winter season, there is a sudden and strange laziness which follows a drop in temperature. Sometimes, it is all right to stay under the blanket, watching your favourite shows and enjoying a warm brew — coffee, hot chocolate, spiced tea, etc.  Eat one portion of dessert, if absolutely dying, preferably for lunch not dinner., Start meal with a soup and/ or salad, so as to pack less carbs., Drink minimum 2 litres of water, and no, chai and coffee don’t count as water.And alcohol most certainly doesn’t — it’s dehydrating., Eat on time and mostly before going out; “I don’t panic - eat.”, Break workout into two parts — a bit of yoga and stretching in the morning.Gym / walking in the evening.. “has better results than just one workout.” ",

    explanation:
      "It is important to mix your workouts for effective results, and also to not let your fitness routine hit a plateau. Reiterating the importance of the same, fitness trainer Shwetambari Shetty said that one should mix their workout routines between cardio, strength, mobility, flexibility. “I’m all for that and I practice it myself,” It helps elevate your metabolism. Lifting causes an increase in the body’s resting metabolic rate — the rate at which it burns calories when you’re doing nothing—for hours after the workout which helps better fat burn. “Lifting heavy weights makes the body more insulin sensitive (means that the body is better able to utilise sugars and carbohydrates for fuel),” ",
